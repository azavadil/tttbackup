States are represented as a tuple of (p, me, you, pending) where
p:       an int, 0 or 1, indicating which player's turn it is.
me:      an int, the player-to-move's current score
you:     an int, the other player's current score.
pending: an int, the number of points accumulated on current turn, not yet scored
